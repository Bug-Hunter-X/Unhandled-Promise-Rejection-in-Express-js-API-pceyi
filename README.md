This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections. The `bug.js` file contains code that simulates an asynchronous operation that can throw an error.  The error handling is insufficient, as it only logs the error to the console but fails to return an appropriate error response to the client.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
